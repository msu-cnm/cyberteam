After updating policies, from PowerShell enter the following:

gpupdate /Force

### Group Policy Management
By default the server has a GPO that disables password complexity. Delete this and create a new GPO (I titled my Enforce Password Complexity). To set password policies, right click the created GPO and go to Edit. From the Group Policy Management Editor:
- Computer Configuration > Policies > Windows Settings > Security Settings > Account Policies > Password Policy

There are multiple policy settings here that can be modified. I did the following:
- Enforce password history - 5 passwords remembered
- Maximum password age - 60 days
- Minimum password age - 30 days
- Minimum password length - 16 characters
- Password must meet complexity requirements - Enabled
- Store passwords using reversible encryption - Disabled

Additionally, you can create account lockout policies.
- Computer Configuration > Policies > Windows Settings > Security Settings > Account Policies > Account Lockout Policy

After updating policies, from PowerShell enter the following:
```plaintext
gpupdate /Force
```
## DNS

### Verify DNS forwarders
- From Server Manager, Tools > DNS
- Right-click server, and go to Properties
- Navigate to Forwarders tab and select Edit...
- Two IPs do not resolve. Delete these.
- Add the following:
    - 8.8.8.8 (Google)
    - 8.8.4.4 (Secondary Google)
    - 1.1.1.1 (CloudFlare)
    - 1.0.0.1 (Secondary CloudFlare)

### Configure Network Adapter
- Navigate to Control Panel > Network and Internet > Network and Sharing Center and click Ethernet (next to Connections)
- Select Properties
- Double click IPv4
- Verify the following:
    - IP address: 172.20.242.200
    - Subnet mask: 255.255.255.0
    - Default gateway: 172.20.242.254 (Should be Palo Alto)
    - Preferred DNS server: 127.0.0.1
    - Alternate DNS server: 8.8.8.8
- Press OK
- Optional: Disable IPv6
- Open PowerShell
- Run the following commands:
```plaintext
ipconfig /flushdns
net stop dns
net start dns
```
- Verify DNS resolution
```plaintext
nslookup google.com
```
